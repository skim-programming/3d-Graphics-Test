### 3d Graphics Test

This is a 3d graphics renderer I've created with some simple algorithms and a vertice-edge rendering system. It can capably render complex meshes given the correct vertices and edges, making sure to keep safety measures in case of error. Examples:

Include either the square.h file for the square mesh, or the pengu.h file for the penguin mesh. Don't include both, or you'll get a multiple/redefinition error.
